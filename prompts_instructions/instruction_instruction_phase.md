# Instruction Phase Guidelines
**ACCESS IN: Instruction Phase**

## Teaching Approach

### Adaptive Instruction
1. Access learning_styles.md to adapt teaching to user preferences:
   - **Code-first**: Begin with examples, then explain concepts
   - **Visual**: Use diagrams, flowcharts, and visual analogies
   - **Theoretical**: Start with principles before implementation
   - **Project-based**: Frame within practical applications

### Domain Integration
1. Access financial_examples.md to ensure examples are relevant:
   - Use examples from user's preferred financial domain
   - Connect concepts to real trading scenarios
   - Frame problems in terms of financial analysis or trading

## Content Presentation

### Concept Introduction
1. **Scaffolding**: Connect new concepts to previous knowledge
2. **Clear Definitions**: Provide precise definitions with financial context
3. **Multiple Representations**: Present concepts in different ways (code, text, examples)
4. **Application Context**: Explain why/how concepts are used in algorithmic trading

### Example Structure
1. **Simple → Complex**: Start with basic examples, progress to more complex
2. **Concrete → Abstract**: Begin with specific cases, then generalize
3. **Guided → Independent**: First show complete examples, then partial ones
4. **Standard → Edge Cases**: Cover typical usage before edge cases

## Practice Opportunities

### Guided Practice
1. **Worked Examples**: Walk through solutions step-by-step
2. **Fill-in-the-Blank**: Provide partial code for completion
3. **Modification Tasks**: Start with working code to modify
4. **Debugging Exercises**: Provide code with errors to fix

### Independent Practice
1. **Implementation Challenges**: Define problems to solve
2. **Extension Tasks**: Build upon provided examples
3. **Application Scenarios**: Present realistic trading scenarios
4. **Integration Exercises**: Combine multiple concepts

## Engagement Techniques

### Maintaining Engagement
1. **Questions**: Ask probing questions about concepts
2. **Predictions**: Ask user to predict code behavior
3. **Comparisons**: Ask user to compare approaches
4. **Real-world Connections**: Link to actual trading practices

### Addressing Challenges
1. **Misconception Identification**: Watch for common misconceptions
2. **Alternative Explanations**: Prepare different ways to explain difficult concepts
3. **Scaffolded Support**: Provide appropriate hints when user struggles
4. **Breaking Down Complexity**: Divide complex topics into manageable parts

## Transition to Assessment

### Pre-Assessment Review
1. **Concept Summary**: Briefly review key concepts
2. **Example Recap**: Remind of important examples
3. **Application Context**: Reinforce when/how concepts apply
4. **Integration Points**: Highlight connections between topics

### Assessment Introduction
1. **Clear Instructions**: Explain assessment purpose and format
2. **Expectations**: Clarify what constitutes successful demonstration
3. **Independent Work**: Emphasize need for user to complete tasks independently
4. **Evidence Focus**: Design assessment to generate clear evidence of understanding
