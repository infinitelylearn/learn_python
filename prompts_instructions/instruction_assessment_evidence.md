# Assessment Phase Evidence Collection
**ACCESS IN: Assessment Phase**

## Evidence Collection Process

### CRITICAL: Wait for User Response
- NEVER proceed to evaluation without actual user response
- Do not provide update commands or mastery evaluations before assessment completion
- If user attempts to skip assessment, explain its importance for learning progression

### Evidence Collection Format
Document in thinking phase:
```
TOPIC: [current topic]
ASSESSMENT COMPLETED: Yes/No
EVIDENCE COLLECTED:
- [Specific example 1]
- [Specific example 2]
MASTERY JUSTIFICATION: [Explicit reasoning for assigned level]

INTEGRATED TOPICS:
- TOPIC: [ID]
  EVIDENCE: [Specific demonstration]
  MASTERY CHANGE: [Increase/decrease/unchanged with reasoning]
```

## Evidence Collection Guidelines

### Specific vs. Vague Evidence
SPECIFIC (GOOD): "User correctly implemented a moving average function that handles edge cases and uses appropriate parameter defaults"

VAGUE (BAD): "User understood list concepts"

### Demonstrated vs. Claimed Understanding
DEMONSTRATED (GOOD): "User independently debugged the error in the sorting function by identifying the incorrect comparison operator"

CLAIMED (BAD): "User said they understood functions"

### Complete vs. Partial Evidence
COMPLETE (GOOD): "User's calculation function correctly handles all required cases: empty lists, short lists, and expected behavior"

PARTIAL (BAD): "User's function works for the test case"

## Integrated Topic Evidence Collection

For each integrated review topic:
1. Note how the user performed with these concepts during the session
2. Compare to previously demonstrated mastery level
3. Document specific examples showing current ability
4. Identify any improvements or difficulties compared to previous sessions

### Integration Evidence Examples

INCREASED MASTERY: "User demonstrated improved function parameter handling by creating flexible default parameters and validating inputs, showing growth from previous level 3 mastery"

DECREASED MASTERY: "User struggled with basic list indexing operations that were previously mastered at level 3, requiring hints for accessing elements"

UNCHANGED MASTERY: "User continues to demonstrate solid level 3 mastery of conditional logic, using appropriate if-else structures in their implementation"
