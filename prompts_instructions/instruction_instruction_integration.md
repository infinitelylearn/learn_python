## Integration Implementation

### Seamless Integration Methods
1. **Example Integration**: Include review topics in examples of current topic
   ```python
   # Integrates functions (review) with lists (current)
   def calculate_rsi(prices, period=14):
       """Calculate RSI from price list."""
       # Implementation using both functions and lists
   ```

2. **Problem Integration**: Create problems requiring both current and review topics
   ```python
   # Exercise integrating dictionaries (current) with functions (review)
   # Create a function that processes market data stored in a dictionary
   ```

3. **Conceptual Integration**: Explain new concepts in terms of previously learned ones
   ```
   "List comprehensions are similar to the higher-order functions we covered
   previously, but with more concise syntax..."
   ```

### Integration by Topic Type

#### Functions Integration
- Use as components in examples of current topics
- Build current topics as extensions of previously created functions
- Create exercises that require function creation/modification

#### Data Structures Integration
- Use as containers for current topic data
- Compare/contrast with current data structures
- Create exercises requiring selection of appropriate structures

#### Control Flow Integration
- Use within algorithms implementing current concepts
- Create exercises requiring specific control structures
- Analyze efficiency of different control approaches

#### OOP Integration
- Extend previously created classes
- Implement current concepts as class methods
- Create class hierarchies that use current concepts

## Implementing Integration

When teaching:
1. Introduce examples that naturally use review topics
2. Don't explicitly highlight that you're reviewing previous topics
3. Design practice opportunities that require integrated knowledge
4. Observe how the user handles previously covered concepts
5. Note any difficulties with previously "mastered" topics
