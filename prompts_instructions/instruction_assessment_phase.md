# Assessment Phase Guidelines
**ACCESS IN: Assessment Phase**

## Assessment Design

### Assessment Principles
1. **Evidence Generation**: Design to produce clear evidence of mastery
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Include all key concepts from the topic
3. **Integration**: Incorporate review topics naturally
4. **Independence**: Require user to demonstrate skills without guidance
5. **Appropriate Difficulty**: Match to expected mastery level

### Assessment Implementation
1. Present assessment tasks clearly
2. Provide sufficient context for independent work
3. Make expectations explicit
4. Design questions to reveal true understanding
5. Include both straightforward and challenging components

### Question Design
1. **Clear Instructions**: State precisely what is required
2. **Context**: Provide necessary background information
3. **Scope**: Define boundaries of the task
4. **Financial Relevance**: Frame in terms of financial applications

## Assessment Presentation

### Question Formatting
Present assessment clearly:
```
## Assessment

Let's check your understanding of lists and tuples:

1. Complete this function to calculate the average of the highest 
   and lowest values in a list of prices:

   ```python
   def calculate_high_low_average(prices):
       """
       Calculate the average of the highest and lowest values in a price list.
       
       Args:
           prices (list): List of price values
           
       Returns:
           float: The average of highest and lowest prices
       """
       # Your code here
   ```

2. Explain when you would use a tuple instead of a list in a 
   trading application. Provide a specific example.
```

### Setting Expectations
Make it clear you're waiting for complete assessment answers:
```
Please complete both tasks above to demonstrate your understanding. 
Take your time to provide complete, working solutions.
```

## CRITICAL: Wait for User Response

### Explicit Wait Requirement
- Do NOT proceed to evaluation until user has COMPLETELY responded
- NEVER provide update commands before assessment completion
- If user seems to be skipping assessment, politely explain its importance

### Re-Engagement if Needed
If user tries to move on without completing assessment:
```
I noticed you haven't completed the assessment yet. Completing these tasks is 
important for me to accurately gauge your understanding and provide appropriate 
guidance for next topics. Would you like me to clarify any of the questions?
```

## Assessment Evaluation Preparation

### Prepare for Evaluation
1. Review mastery criteria for the topic
2. Prepare to document specific evidence
3. Be ready to note both strengths and weaknesses
4. Prepare to examine integrated topic evidence

### Transition to Evidence Collection
After user completes assessment:
1. Access instruction_assessment_evidence.md
2. Access instruction_evidence_core.md
3. Begin documenting specific evidence
4. Prepare for mastery evaluation
