# Update Phase Evidence Verification
**ACCESS IN: Update Phase**

## Evidence Verification Process

### Evidence Documentation Template
Complete this template in the thinking phase before generating any update commands:

```
MAIN TOPIC: [ID]
MASTERY LEVEL: [1-5]
SPECIFIC EVIDENCE:
- [Evidence item 1]
- [Evidence item 2]
JUSTIFICATION: [Why this evidence supports this mastery level]

INTEGRATED TOPIC 1: [ID]
PREVIOUS MASTERY: [1-5]
NEW MASTERY: [1-5 or "unchanged"]
SPECIFIC EVIDENCE:
- [Evidence item 1]
- [Evidence item 2]
JUSTIFICATION: [Why this evidence supports changing/maintaining mastery]

INTEGRATED TOPIC 2: [ID]
...
```

## Common Evidence Documentation Errors

1. **Vague Evidence**: "User understood lists" vs "User correctly implemented list slicing to extract specific trading days from price data"

2. **Acceptance without Demonstration**: "User said they understood" vs "User demonstrated understanding by implementing a working solution"

3. **Insufficient Evidence**: Only documenting one example when multiple are required

4. **Mismatched Evidence**: Evidence that doesn't actually demonstrate the claimed mastery level

5. **Unjustified Changes**: Changing mastery without specific evidence

## Session Notes for Update Command

Create concise but specific session notes that include:
1. Key concepts covered
2. Notable strengths demonstrated
3. Areas needing additional practice
4. Evidence-based mastery observations

Example:
```
notes=User demonstrated strong list manipulation (created working moving average function) but needs more practice with list comprehensions. Function implementation showed improved parameter handling from previous session.
```

## Final Verification Checklist

Before finalizing update commands:
- Assessment was fully completed
- Evidence is documented for each mastery level assignment
- Evidence is specific and concrete (not general impressions)
- Evidence is sufficient to justify assigned levels
- Any mastery changes to previous topics have explicit evidence
- Session notes accurately reflect observed strengths and needs
