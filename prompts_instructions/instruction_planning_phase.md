# Planning Phase Instructions
**ACCESS IN: Planning Phase**

## MASTERY PROGRESSION CHECKPOINT - COMPLETE FIRST
1. List ALL topics with mastery < 4 from module files
2. If ANY exist, this session MUST focus on strengthening these topics
3. Prepare specific exercises to demonstrate level 4-5 mastery
4. Only proceed to new topics if ALL prerequisites have mastery >= 4
5. Document your completion of this checkpoint explicitly

## Initial Analysis

### Learning Progress Analysis
1. Check master_plan.yaml for:
   - Current active modules
   - Last session information
   - Learning preferences

2. Analyze module files to identify:
   - Completed topics with mastery levels
   - Currently active topics
   - Next topics by priority order
   - Prerequisite relationships

### Topic Selection Process
1. Apply mastery-based progression rules:
   - If most recent topic mastery < 4: Continue strengthening that topic
   - If prerequisite topics for next topic < 4: Focus on strengthening prerequisites
   - Otherwise: Proceed to next sequential topic by priority number

2. Check prerequisites:
   - Verify all prerequisites have adequate mastery (3+)
   - Identify any prerequisite gaps that need addressing
   - DEFAULT new topics to mastery level 1

## Session Plan Creation

### Session Structure
Plan a clear session structure:
1. **Introduction**: Connect to previous knowledge, set expectations
2. **Concept Presentation**: Explain new concepts with examples
3. **Guided Practice**: Provide supported application opportunities
4. **Independent Practice**: Allow self-directed application
5. **Assessment**: Verify understanding and mastery
6. **Summary**: Reinforce key points, preview next topics

### Time Allocation
Allocate session time based on complexity:
- Topic introduction: 20-25%
- Concept explanation: 30-35%
- Practice opportunities: 25-30%
- Assessment: 15-20%

### Session Plan Template
```
Based on your progress, here's my plan for today's session:

Main focus: [primary topic] - We'll cover [specific concepts]
Review topics: [previous topics to reinforce] - These connect to our main topic through [relationship]
Practice: We'll include [specific exercises/examples]
Assessment: We'll end with [assessment approach] to check your mastery

Does this plan work for you, or would you like to adjust anything?
```

## Plan Presentation

### User Presentation
Present your plan clearly but concisely to the user:
1. State the main topic and key concepts
2. Briefly mention how previous topics will be reinforced
3. Ask for confirmation or adjustment preferences
4. Be prepared to modify the plan based on user feedback

### Session Types
Adapt plan presentation based on session type:
1. **New Topic Introduction**: Emphasize building on foundations
2. **Skill Building**: Focus on practice and application
3. **Topic Review**: Highlight areas for reinforcement
4. **Project-Based**: Frame within practical application
5. **Assessment-Focused**: Emphasize comprehensive evaluation
