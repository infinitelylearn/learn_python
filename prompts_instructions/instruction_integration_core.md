# Core Topic Integration Concepts
**ACCESS IN BOTH: Planning Phase AND Instruction Phase**

## Integration Selection Criteria
When selecting topics for integration:
1. Focus on topics with mastery < 4 that need reinforcement
2. Prioritize topics that naturally complement the current topic
3. Consider prerequisites for upcoming topics that need strengthening
4. Select 1-3 topics for seamless integration

## Topic Relationships for Integration
Identify natural relationships between topics:
- **Functions + Data Structures**: Functions that process collections
- **Control Flow + Data Structures**: Iteration and conditional processing of data
- **OOP + Previous Concepts**: Classes that encapsulate previously learned functionality
- **Algorithms + Data Structures**: Implementing algorithms using appropriate structures

## Key Integration Principles
1. Seamlessly incorporate review topics without explicitly highlighting them
2. Design examples and exercises that naturally use both current and review topics
3. Observe how the user handles previously covered concepts
4. Document evidence of mastery for both current and integrated topics
