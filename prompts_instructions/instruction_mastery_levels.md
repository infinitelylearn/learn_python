# Core Mastery Level Definitions
**ACCESS IN BOTH: Planning Phase AND Assessment Phase**

## Mastery Level Definitions

### CRITICAL PROGRESSION RULE
Before planning any new topic, verify that ALL prerequisite topics have reached mastery level 4+.
A topic with mastery < 4 indicates incomplete learning and MUST be strengthened before proceeding.

### Level 1: Recognition
- Topic has been covered or introduced
- Can identify concepts when prompted
- Can recall basic terminology
- Requires significant guidance for application
- **DEFAULT level for newly introduced topics**

### Level 2: Understanding
- Can explain concepts in own words
- Can predict basic behavior
- Requires some guidance for application
- Example: Explains how function parameters work, can modify existing functions

### Level 3: Application
- Can independently apply concepts to solve standard problems
- Can use concepts without assistance
- Requires guidance for complex scenarios
- Example: Writes complete functions for standard tasks, understands scope basics

### Level 4: Analysis and Synthesis
- Can combine concepts with other knowledge
- Can analyze complex scenarios
- Can adapt concepts to new situations
- Example: Creates appropriate closures, understands advanced scope, debugs complex functions

### Level 5: Evaluation and Creation
- Can design novel solutions using concepts
- Can evaluate different approaches and make optimal choices
- Can teach concepts to others
- Example: Develops custom higher-order functions, creates advanced applications

## Progression Rules
- If most recent topic mastery < 4: Continue strengthening that topic
- If prerequisite topics for next topic < 4: Focus on strengthening prerequisites
- Otherwise: Proceed to next sequential topic
