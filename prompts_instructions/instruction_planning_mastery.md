# Planning Phase Mastery Considerations
**ACCESS IN: Planning Phase**

## Mastery-Based Planning

### Topic Categorization
Begin by categorizing previously covered topics by mastery level:
- **REMEDIAL (Level 1-2)**: Topics requiring focused reinforcement
- **DEVELOPING (Level 3)**: Topics requiring additional practice
- **PROFICIENT (Level 4)**: Topics with strong application abilities
- **MASTERED (Level 5)**: Topics with expert-level understanding

### Target Mastery Selection
For the current topic:
1. If current mastery is 0 (new topic): Target Level 1-2
2. If current mastery is 1-2: Target Level 3
3. If current mastery is 3: Target Level 4
4. If current mastery is 4: Target Level 5

### Planning for Current Mastery Level
Adapt teaching approach based on current mastery:
- **Level 1**: Introduce core concepts with simple examples
- **Level 2**: Focus on common patterns and standard applications
- **Level 3**: Introduce complex scenarios and optimization
- **Level 4**: Present advanced patterns and novel applications

## Assessment Design Planning

### Planning Assessment Types
For target mastery level:
- **Level 2**: Plan explanation, prediction, and simple modification tasks
- **Level 3**: Plan implementation and standard problem-solving tasks
- **Level 4**: Plan analysis, optimization, and integration challenges
- **Level 5**: Plan design, evaluation, and novel problem tasks

### Planning Integrated Assessment
For review topics:
1. Identify current mastery level of each review topic
2. Plan assessment components that will demonstrate current or improved mastery
3. Ensure assessment will generate clear evidence for mastery evaluation
