# Assessment Phase Mastery Evaluation
**ACCESS IN: Assessment Phase**

## Assessment Design by Level

### Level 2 Assessment Design (Understanding)
- **Explanation Questions**: "Explain in your own words how list slicing works."
- **Prediction Tasks**: "What will this code output? `prices[1:4]`"
- **Concept Questions**: "What is the difference between lists and tuples?"
- **Simple Modifications**: "Modify this function to accept an additional parameter."

### Level 3 Assessment Design (Application)
- **Implementation Tasks**: "Write a function that calculates moving averages."
- **Problem-Solving**: "Create a program that finds the highest return in this dataset."
- **Debugging**: "Fix the errors in this trading algorithm function."
- **Application Scenarios**: "Implement a function that calculates position size based on risk."

### Level 4 Assessment Design (Analysis/Synthesis)
- **Optimization Tasks**: "Refactor this code to make it more efficient."
- **Integration Challenges**: "Combine these techniques to build a complete trading system."
- **Comparison Tasks**: "Compare these two approaches and explain the trade-offs."
- **Extension Problems**: "Extend this function to handle multiple currency pairs."

### Level 5 Assessment Design (Evaluation/Creation)
- **Design Challenges**: "Design a system to automatically identify trading patterns."
- **Novel Problems**: "Create a solution for this complex trading scenario."
- **Evaluation Tasks**: "Evaluate different approaches to portfolio optimization."
- **Teaching Tasks**: "Explain how you would teach someone to implement this algorithm."

## Topic-Specific Assessment Guidelines

### Python Fundamentals
- **Level 3**: Creates useful functions with appropriate parameters and return values
- **Level 4**: Uses nested functions, closures, or decorators appropriately
- **Level 5**: Designs pythonic, reusable code patterns

### Data Structures
- **Level 3**: Selects appropriate data structures for different data types
- **Level 4**: Optimizes data structures for performance
- **Level 5**: Creates custom data structures for specialized operations

### Numerical Computing
- **Level 3**: Implements basic vectorized operations
- **Level 4**: Optimizes numerical computations for performance
- **Level 5**: Creates sophisticated numerical algorithms

### Machine Learning
- **Level 3**: Implements and trains basic models
- **Level 4**: Tunes hyperparameters and evaluates model performance
- **Level 5**: Develops custom models or ensemble methods

## Assessment Application

During assessment:
1. Implement assessments designed during planning
2. Ensure assessments will generate evidence of mastery
3. Wait for user to complete assessment tasks
4. Evaluate responses against defined mastery criteria
5. Document specific evidence for each mastery level assignment
