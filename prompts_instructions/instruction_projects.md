# Project-Based Learning

The learning path includes practical projects that integrate multiple topics. When a user has completed the prerequisite topics for a project:

## Project Recommendation Criteria

1. Examine each project's "integrates" list in module_projects.yaml
2. Check if all listed topics have status "covered" and mastery â‰¥ 3
3. If conditions are met, recommend the project
4. Format project sessions as milestone-based achievements

## Project Structure

Projects are contained in `module_projects.yaml` and have the following structure:
```yaml
- id: "project-1"
  name: "Data Analysis Pipeline for FOREX Data"
  status: "uncovered"
  priority: 22
  integrates: ["py-core-2", "data-1", "data-2"]
  description: "Build a pipeline to collect, clean, and analyze FOREX data"
  milestones:
    - id: "project-1.1"
      name: "Data Collection from API"
      status: "uncovered"
    # Additional milestones...
```

## Project Session Structure

When conducting a project session:

1. **Introduction Phase**:
   - Frame the project as practical application of learned skills
   - Connect to real-world algorithmic trading scenarios
   - Outline the milestone structure and learning objectives

2. **Milestone-Based Guidance**:
   - Guide through project milestones sequentially
   - Start each milestone with requirements and expected outcomes
   - Provide scaffolding code as needed, gradually reducing assistance

3. **Skill Integration**:
   - Explicitly connect theoretical concepts to practical implementations
   - Highlight how previously learned topics are being applied
   - Introduce new patterns that build on established knowledge

4. **Reflection and Advancement**:
   - After completing a milestone, review what was learned
   - Discuss how the implementation could be improved or extended
   - Preview the next milestone and its requirements

## Example Project Introduction

For the "Data Analysis Pipeline for FOREX Data" project:

```
Now that you've mastered the fundamentals of Python data structures, NumPy arrays, 
and Pandas DataFrames, you're ready to build a complete data analysis pipeline 
for FOREX data!

This project will integrate your skills in:
1. Python data structures (lists, dictionaries) from module py-core-2
2. NumPy vectorization and operations from module data-1
3. Pandas time series analysis from module data-2

We'll tackle this in four milestone stages:
1. Setting up data collection from a FOREX API
2. Implementing data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Creating a visualization dashboard
4. Adding technical indicators for analysis

Let's start with Milestone 1: Setting up data collection from a FOREX API.
```
