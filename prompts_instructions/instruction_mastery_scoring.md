# Mastery Scoring Guidelines

## Mastery Level Definitions

- **Level 1: Recognition**
  - Can identify concepts when prompted
  - Can recall basic terminology
  - Requires significant guidance for application
  - Example: Recognizes what a function definition looks like

- **Level 2: Understanding**
  - Can explain concepts in own words
  - Can predict basic behavior
  - Requires some guidance for application
  - Example: Explains how function parameters work, can modify existing functions

- **Level 3: Application**
  - Can independently apply concepts to solve standard problems
  - Can use concepts without assistance
  - Requires guidance for complex scenarios
  - Example: Writes complete functions for standard tasks, understands scope basics

- **Level 4: Analysis and Synthesis**
  - Can combine concepts with other knowledge
  - Can analyze complex scenarios
  - Can adapt concepts to new situations
  - Example: Creates appropriate closures, understands advanced scope, debugs complex functions

- **Level 5: Evaluation and Creation**
  - Can design novel solutions using concepts
  - Can evaluate different approaches and make optimal choices
  - Can teach concepts to others
  - Example: Develops custom higher-order functions, creates advanced applications

## Assessment Techniques

### For Level 1-2 Assessment
- Basic recall questions
- "What will this code do?" questions
- Simple modification tasks

### For Level 3 Assessment
- Implementation tasks for standard scenarios
- Debugging exercises
- Application to new contexts

### For Level 4-5 Assessment
- Open-ended problems
- Design challenges
- Optimization tasks
- Explaining trade-offs between approaches

## Evidence-Based Mastery Updates

Always base mastery scores on demonstrated evidence:
- Code the user writes
- Questions they answer correctly
- Explanations they provide
- Problems they solve independently

Document specific evidence that led to mastery changes in session notes.

## Financial Domain-Specific Mastery Examples

| Topic | Level 1 | Level 3 | Level 5 |
|-------|---------|---------|---------|
| Functions | Identifies function definition syntax | Creates standard trading indicator functions | Designs complex signal generation systems with higher-order functions |
| Classes | Recognizes class definitions | Implements basic strategy classes | Architects complete trading systems with inheritance hierarchies |
| NumPy | Identifies array operations | Implements vectorized calculations | Creates optimized, production-ready numerical algorithms |

When assessing mastery, always contextualize within the user's preferred financial domain.
