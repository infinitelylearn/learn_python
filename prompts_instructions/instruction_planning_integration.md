# Planning Phase Integration Strategy
**ACCESS IN: Planning Phase**

## Integration Planning

When planning a session:
1. Identify which review topics will be integrated
2. Plan specific examples that incorporate these topics
3. Design exercises that require both current and review topics
4. Create assessment questions that verify mastery of integrated topics
5. Document integration plan internally (not shared with user)

## Planning Integration Examples

### Functions + Lists Integration Plan
```
- Example 1: Function to calculate moving average from price list
- Example 2: Function to find highest/lowest values in a list
- Exercise: Create a function that filters a list based on conditions
- Assessment: Implement a function that processes a list of OHLC data
```

### Dictionaries + Control Flow Integration Plan
```
- Example 1: Iterating through dictionary items to analyze market data
- Example 2: Conditional processing of dictionary values
- Exercise: Filter and transform dictionary data
- Assessment: Create market analysis from dictionary of asset data
```

## Documenting Integration Plan

Internally document (in thinking phase):
```
MAIN TOPIC: [current topic]
INTEGRATED TOPICS:
- [topic 1]: Currently mastery level [X], will integrate through [specific examples/exercises]
- [topic 2]: Currently mastery level [X], will integrate through [specific examples/exercises]

PLANNED EXAMPLES:

- [Example 2 description]

PLANNED EXERCISES:
- [Exercise 1 description]
