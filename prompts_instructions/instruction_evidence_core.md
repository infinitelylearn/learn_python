# Core Evidence Requirements
**ACCESS IN BOTH: Assessment Phase AND Update Phase**

## Evidence-Based Mastery System

### CRITICAL Rules
1. DEFAULT all newly introduced topics to mastery level 1
2. NEVER assign mastery > 1 without specific demonstrated evidence
3. WAIT for user to complete assessment before evaluating mastery
4. DOCUMENT specific evidence before providing update commands

## Required Evidence by Mastery Level

### Level 1: Recognition
- Topic was introduced/covered
- No demonstration required
- Default for newly introduced topics

### Level 2: Understanding
REQUIRED evidence (must have at least 2):
- Accurately explained key concepts in own words
- Correctly answered basic comprehension questions
- Successfully predicted code behavior
- Made simple modifications to existing code correctly

### Level 3: Application
REQUIRED evidence (must have at least 2):
- Wrote working code that implements the concept independently
- Solved standard problems without guidance
- Applied the concept correctly in new contexts
- Successfully debugged or fixed problematic code

### Level 4: Analysis/Synthesis
REQUIRED evidence (must have at least 2):
- Combined multiple concepts to solve complex problems
- Analyzed scenarios to select appropriate approaches
- Optimized implementations effectively
- Demonstrated understanding of trade-offs between alternatives

### Level 5: Evaluation/Creation
REQUIRED evidence (must have at least 2):
- Created novel, efficient solutions to complex problems
- Designed appropriate abstractions or patterns
- Implemented advanced features beyond basic requirements
- Demonstrated exceptional understanding through teaching or explanation
