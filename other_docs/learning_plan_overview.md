# Comprehensive Learning Plan for Financial and AI Career Transition

## Personal Background & Context

**Current Profile:**
- Train driver since 2017 (£75k salary)
- 1st class BSc in Audio and Recording Technology (2012)
- Post-production studio experience, including department management
- Strong problem-solving aptitude with technical troubleshooting skills
- Self-directed learning in Python, AI, and financial engineering
- Age: 34

**Technical Foundation:**
- Early exposure to computers (MS-DOS at age 2, built computer at 13)
- Currently developing Python skills through self-study
- Working on algorithmic trading projects using AI assistance (Claude 3.7)
- Needs structured learning to transition from "understanding concepts" to "implementation proficiency"

## Career Goals

**Short-term (2-3 years):**
- Maintain stability for immigration requirements (wife's visa)
- Develop profitable algorithmic trading systems with prop firms
- Possibly transition to FinTech role (£100k+ salary)

**Mid-term (3-5 years):**
- Scale trading operations or advance in quantitative finance
- Target compensation: £150-300K range
- Develop location independence (mentioned interest in remote work, Turkey connection)

**Long-term:**
- Target compensation: £1M+ annually (combination of salary/trading profits)
- Financial independence and early retirement
- Possibly entrepreneurial ventures in FinTech or prop trading

## Current Trading Context

- Operating two prop firm evaluation accounts (400k and 200k)
- Potential to scale to 2M and 5M respectively
- Developing custom multi-agent AI framework for trading strategies
- Currently limited by programming implementation skills

## Learning Objectives

### Programming Fundamentals
- Complete Python mastery focusing on performance optimization
- Object-oriented and functional programming paradigms
- Concurrent programming and parallelization techniques
- Specialized knowledge of Numba for near-C++ performance

### Financial Engineering
- Financial data acquisition, cleaning, and processing
- Technical analysis and indicator implementation
- Backtesting framework development
- Risk management systems
- Performance metrics and portfolio optimization

### Artificial Intelligence
- Machine learning fundamentals for time series
- Deep learning with focus on sequence models
- Reinforcement learning for trading strategy development
- Multi-agent systems architecture
- Meta-learning for adaptive trading strategies

### Production Systems
- Event-driven architecture
- Fault-tolerant system design
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Trading system implementation

## Learning Approach

The user has created a specialized learning framework with:
- Modular curriculum progressing from fundamentals to advanced topics
- Spaced repetition and active recall methodology
- Progressive assessment difficulty with targeted feedback
- Tracked mastery metrics for each topic/subtopic
- GitHub-based progress tracking

**Learning Style Preferences:**
- Practical over theoretical learning
- Problem-solving orientation
- Active application rather than passive consumption
- Self-directed but structured progression
- Available study time: ~10-15 hours weekly

**Learning Challenges:**
- Balancing full-time employment with learning
- Bridging the gap between concept recognition and implementation
- Building production-grade skills without professional programming experience

## Priority Learning Areas

1. **Python optimization techniques** (Numba, multiprocessing) to create performant trading algorithms
2. **Financial data analysis** with NumPy/Pandas for trading strategy development
3. **Backtesting framework implementation** for strategy validation
4. **Reinforcement learning** application to trading systems
5. **Multi-agent frameworks** for complex trading decision systems

This comprehensive learning path combines three distinct objectives: developing professional-grade Python programming skills, mastering algorithmic trading techniques, and implementing advanced AI methodologies—all directed toward financial independence through either proprietary trading success or high-compensation FinTech career opportunities.
